##Introduction

I wanted to create this space to gather random bits of information from conferences, web authors, web sites. Things that others have done and found good.
Accumulate all this goodness in one place and then sift through it and examine what different tools or process might be appropriate for my situation.
Clearly there are so many tools and process flows available. Some will work for us and some won't without change.
This is not intended to be a recommendation of any tools, sites or process other than for my own purposes.
